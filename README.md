Hello, now I provide Task 4 with you.

That's the part, we write vulnerable Java code and it should be detected by SonarCloud.


First of all , let's talk about your subjective learning outputs from statement/branch/predicate coverage researches.

From [here](coverage.md) , you can see our **coverage.md** file.   


Now, it's time to write 10 methods due to our logic.
I wrote like [this](src/main/java/org/example/User.java),


Now, it's time to code Junit 5 methods.
I wrote like [this](src/test/java/org/example/UserTest.java)

Let's check our Junit test methods.
